**Pursae Cache** is a built-in plugin (on by default) that caches rendered public pages inside the
Go process, purges them precisely by tags when content changes, and can tell a front proxy or CDN
to cache them as well. It is modelled on LiteSpeed Cache but works with any server.

Find it under **Pursae Cache** in the admin menu (Dashboard, Cache, Page Optimization, Toolbox) and
switch it off or on under Plugins.

## What is cached

GET requests of the public site from visitors who are not logged in and carry no comment-author
cookie. Pages that set cookies, send `Cache-Control: private`/`no-store`, or that the app marks
with `X-WPGo-Cache-Control: no-cache` (forms with nonces) are never cached. Responses carry
`X-WPGo-Cache: hit|miss|bypass`.

## Settings (Pursae Cache › Cache)

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `wpgo_cache_enabled` | on | the plugin |
| `wpgo_cache_ttl_public` | 7 days | TTL of posts, pages and archives |
| `wpgo_cache_ttl_front` | 7 days | TTL of the front page |
| `wpgo_cache_ttl_feed` | 7 days | TTL of feeds |
| `wpgo_cache_ttl_404` | 1 hour | TTL of not-found pages |
| `wpgo_cache_mobile` | off | separate cache entries for mobile user agents |
| `wpgo_cache_logged_in` | off | cache for logged-in users too (per user) |
| `wpgo_cache_exclude_uri` | — | one path prefix per line that is never cached |
| `wpgo_cache_drop_qs` | — | query parameters ignored for the cache key (tracking parameters) |
| `wpgo_cache_disk` | off | persist entries to disk so they survive a restart |
| `wpgo_cache_server` | `auto` | which proxy headers to emit: `auto`, `litespeed`, `nginx`, `generic`, `none` |

Page Optimization (`wpgo_opt_*`): lazy-load images (skipping the first ones above the fold),
defer scripts (with an exclusion list), minify HTML, preload the theme's fonts.

## Tags and purging

Every cached page is tagged (`home`, `post:12`, `term:3`, `author:1`, `media:7`, `feed`,
`date:2026-10`, `archive:post`, `404`, `search`). Publishing or editing a post purges its own
page, the home page, feeds, its author and term archives and the dates it belongs to; comments purge the post; editing or deleting a term purges
the pages listing or linking it (deleting a category also its posts' new default category);
editing or deleting a media item purges the pages showing it as a featured image; settings,
theme, menu and widget changes purge everything. With several instances on one database every
purge reaches all of them ([several instances](reverse-proxy-and-tls.md#several-instances)). Plugins that change posts through the
[posts API](../plugins/host-api.md) trigger the same purges, and saving a plugin settings page
purges everything.

A page whose render overlaps a purge that covers it (a post saved while the page was being
built) is sent to that visitor but not stored, so the purge always wins. Concurrent misses of the
same anonymous page are rendered once: the other requests wait (up to 10 s) and are then served
from the cache; when that render was not cacheable they render the page themselves.

The admin bar has **Purge this page** and **Purge all**; Toolbox has a crawler that warms the
cache after a purge.

## Front proxies

| `wpgo_cache_server` | Headers emitted |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| `litespeed` | `X-LiteSpeed-Cache-Control`, `X-LiteSpeed-Tag` |
| `nginx` | `X-Accel-Expires` for `proxy_cache` / `fastcgi_cache` |
| `generic` | `Cache-Control: s-maxage`, `Surrogate-Key` and `Cache-Tag` (Varnish, Fastly, Cloudflare) |
| `auto` | LiteSpeed headers only when the request came through LiteSpeed; nothing otherwise |
| `none` | in-process cache only |

**Purges reach the proxy.** Set *Front Server Purge URL* in Cache Settings and every purge of the
in-process cache is forwarded there as a `PURGE` request: a URL purge goes to the purge URL plus
the page path, a tag purge carries `Surrogate-Key` (Varnish, Fastly), `Cache-Tag` (Cloudflare) and
`X-LiteSpeed-Purge` headers listing the prefixed tags (`wpgo_` by default), a full purge sends
`X-Purge-All: 1` and `X-LiteSpeed-Purge: *`. Requests are sent in the background with a 5 s
timeout. While no purge URL is set, *Front Server Lifetime* (default 300 s) caps `s-maxage`,
`X-Accel-Expires` and `X-LiteSpeed-Cache-Control` so a changed page is stale for minutes, not days,
and Cache Settings shows a warning.

## Cache Settings and Page Optimization options

Besides the TTLs: *Enable Cache* (stops caching but keeps the plugin and its screens; the plugin
itself is switched on the Plugins screen, option `wpgo_cache_enabled`; the cache switch is
`wpgo_cache_serve`), *Cache Query Strings*, *Do Not Cache Cookies*, *Do Not Cache User Agents*,
*Browser Cache TTL*, *301 Redirect TTL*, *Memory Limit*, and *Preload* (after every purge, 30 s
debounced, and daily). The crawler takes its URLs from the core sitemap providers (home, every
public post type, taxonomy and author) and stores its last result in `wpgo_cache_warm_result`.
Page Optimization adds *Defer All JavaScript* with an exclude list, *Delay JavaScript* (scripts that
contain a listed fragment load on the first interaction or after a timeout), inline CSS
minification and preconnect / dns-prefetch origins.
