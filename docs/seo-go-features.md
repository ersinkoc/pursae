# Pursae SEO: feature map (Yoast SEO Premium + Rank Math Pro → Pursae)

Pursae SEO is the native SEO plugin of Pursae. It takes the union of what Yoast SEO (Premium)
and Rank Math (Pro) do and presents it as one plugin with a WordPress-style admin UI. It is
compiled in like Classic Editor, Pursae Cache and Pursae Web Builder. It is **off on a fresh install**, and
while it is off the site, the editors and the admin menu are exactly as without it: its routes
answer 404, nothing is added to `<head>`, and core's `wp-sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` are served.

Verified reference facts (thresholds, meta keys, URL schemes, with source links) are in
[`seo-go-research.md`](seo-go-research.md). This document maps every feature to both plugins and
says what Pursae SEO does with it.

Legend: **✓** implemented · **◐** partly (see note) · **✗** left out (see "Left out" below).

## Design decisions

| Topic | Decision |
|---|---|
| Plugin switch | Option `native_seogo` (Plugins screen, slug `seo-go`). All settings live in one JSON option, `seogo_options` (`seogo.go`). Turning the plugin off keeps settings, meta, redirects and the 404 log. |
| Variables | Pursae SEO writes Rank Math's `%var%` syntax and also accepts Yoast's `%%var%%`. Both plugins' names work (`%term%` and `%term_title%`, `%search_query%` and `%searchphrase%`, `%tagline%` and `%sitedesc%`). After replacement, doubled spaces and dangling separators are removed, as both plugins do. |
| Post and term meta | Pursae SEO stores its own `_seogo_*` keys. Every read falls back to Yoast's `_yoast_wpseo_*` keys and then to Rank Math's `rank_math_*` keys, including Yoast's 0/1/2 noindex flag and Rank Math's serialized PHP robots arrays. A site imported from WordPress keeps its SEO data with no conversion step. *Tools › Import* and the WXR importer also copy that data into Pursae SEO's keys, and the originals stay. |
| Scores | The traffic light uses Yoast's assessments and scores: SEO = Σscore / (n×9) × 100, and readability uses penalty points, giving 30, 60 or 90. Rank Math's tests that Yoast has no counterpart for are listed as unscored "Additional checks". Rank Math's 100-point score is shown next to the SEO heading. |
| Analysis engine | One Go implementation (`seogo_analysis.go`) behind `POST /wp-json/seogo/v1/analyze`, used by both editors, the bulk editor and the stored scores. |
| Editors | One box markup (`seogo/metabox`) and one script (`seogo-editor.js`). In the classic editor it is a meta box at the top of the main column. In Pursae Editor it is a `PluginSidebar` with a toolbar icon and a More-menu item, plus a "Pursae SEO" document settings panel with both scores. |
| Redirect storage | The core `redirects` table, extended by migration `0010_seogo.sql` (match type, status, category, origin, last hit). A new `seogo_404` table holds the 404 log. |
| Sitemaps | Yoast's URL scheme (`/sitemap_index.xml`, `/{type}-sitemap{N}.xml`, `/main-sitemap.xsl`), 1000 URLs per file (configurable), with image entries. `/sitemap.xml` and every `/wp-sitemap*.xml` redirect (301) to the index, as Yoast does. |

## Feature map

### Setup and dashboard

| Feature | Yoast | Rank Math | Pursae SEO |
|---|---|---|---|
| Setup wizard | First-time configuration (site representation, social profiles, personal preferences) | Setup Wizard (site type, logo, Search Console, sitemaps, optimization, role manager) | ✓ Five steps: site representation (organization or person, logo, separator), social profiles, search engines (sitemaps, redirections, 404 monitor, breadcrumbs, IndexNow, single-author site, empty terms), import from Yoast/Rank Math, done. It opens on the first activation. |
| Dashboard | SEO and readability score overview, problems and notifications | Modules grid, Analytics | ✓ SEO and readability distribution of published content, cornerstone count, orphaned content, redirections, logged 404s, SEO problems (search engines discouraged, plain permalinks, default tagline), sitemap link. |
| Modules on/off | (feature toggles) | Modules screen | ✓ Content Analysis, Schema, XML Sitemaps, Breadcrumbs, Redirections, 404 Monitor, Link Counter, Image SEO, Local SEO, News Sitemap, Video Sitemap, Instant Indexing, Role Manager. A module that is off adds nothing. |
| Role manager | — | Role Manager (`rank_math_*` capabilities) | ✓ `seogo_*` capabilities per role (Search Appearance, General, Sitemaps, 404 Monitor, Redirections, Link Builder, Role Manager, and On-Page Analysis/General/Advanced/Schema/Social). Administrators always have all of them. The menu, screens, REST routes and editor tabs check them. |

### Per-post SEO box (classic editor meta box + Pursae Editor sidebar)

| Feature | Yoast | Rank Math | Pursae SEO |
|---|---|---|---|
| Focus keyphrase | Focus keyphrase (+ Premium related keyphrases) | Focus keyword (+ secondary keywords) | ✓ A comma list; the first entry is the focus keyphrase, the others are related keyphrases (checked in the text, unscored). |
| Snippet preview | Google preview, mobile and desktop | Google preview, desktop and mobile | ✓ Mobile and desktop, server-resolved title and description, breadcrumb-style URL, keyphrase highlighted, length/width bars. |
| SEO title and meta description with variables | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ An "Insert variable" menu; empty fields fall back to the Search Appearance template. |
| SEO analysis | 17 assessments | Basic SEO, Additional, Title Readability tests | ✓ All of Yoast's (keyphrase in introduction, length, density with the keyphrase-length factor, in meta description, in subheading, in SEO title, in slug, meta description length, SEO title width, text length for post/cornerstone/taxonomy, outbound and internal links, images, image keyphrase, single H1, competing links, previously used keyphrase) plus Rank Math's keyword in first 10%, URL length, number in title, power words, short paragraphs, table of contents. |
| Readability analysis | Subheading distribution, paragraph length, sentence length, transition words, passive voice, consecutive sentences, text presence; Flesch as an insight | Content readability tests, legacy Flesch | ✓ Yoast's 7 assessments with Yoast's thresholds, including the cornerstone variants. Flesch reading ease and reading time are shown as insights, as Yoast does since 19.3. The post's language (Pursae Multi Language, else `WPLANG`) is respected: English gets every test; Turkish gets transition words with a Turkish list and Turkish-aware lowercasing (I/ı, İ/i); passive voice and Flesch are English-only and skipped elsewhere, and the transition test is skipped for languages without a word list. |
| Traffic lights | Bullets in box, posts list, admin bar | Score badge | ✓ Bullets in the box header, in the Pursae Editor document panel, in the bulk editor and on the dashboard. Scores are stored in `_seogo_seo_score`, `_seogo_read_score` and `_seogo_rm_score`. |
| Cornerstone / pillar content | Cornerstone (stricter analysis) | Pillar content | ✓ Stricter thresholds; shown first in internal linking suggestions; starred in the Link Counter. |
| Canonical URL | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Robots meta | noindex, nofollow, advanced (noarchive, nosnippet, noimageindex) | index/noindex, nofollow, noarchive, noimageindex, nosnippet, max-snippet, max-video-preview, max-image-preview | ✓ All of them; site-wide limits default to `max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1`. |

| Primary category | ✓ | ✓ (Pro) | ✓ Used in breadcrumbs and `%primary_category%`. |
| Social previews | Facebook and X previews with image, title, description | Same | ✓ Open Graph preview card; OG and X title, description and image (Media Library picker). |
| Schema tab | Page type, article type | Schema generator, templates | ◐ Page type (WebPage, AboutPage, FAQPage…), article type (Article, BlogPosting, NewsArticle…, None), **Product** (price, currency, SKU, brand, availability, rating) and **custom JSON-LD**. No visual schema builder or templates. |
| Internal linking suggestions | Premium | Link suggestions (Pro) | ✓ Full-text related content (cornerstone first); "Copy link"; already linked items marked. |

Pursae Web Builder editor: while the builder is on, the same per-post fields live in the builder's
**Page tools** dialog (builder menu) on an **SEO** tab: SEO title, meta description, focus keyphrase,
canonical URL, noindex and nofollow, Open Graph title, description and image, and the SEO score. It
reads and saves through `seogo/v1/meta/{id}`, so the capabilities of the Role Manager apply
(`seogo_onpage_general`; no capability, no tab). Templates (`wb_template`) have no SEO tab. The
builder's page settings (description, indexable) write the same `_seogo_*` meta. Which tabs a page
gets comes from `GET web-builder/v2/documents/{id}/plugins` (docs/developer/web-builder-contract.md
§3.7 in the repository).

### Site-wide settings

### Head output and schema

| Feature | Yoast | Rank Math | Pursae SEO |
|---|---|---|---|
| Title tag | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ Replaces `wp_get_document_title()`. |
| Meta description, robots, canonical, rel prev | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ Core's robots meta and canonical link are replaced (one canonical); no canonical on noindexed pages. |
| Open Graph, article times, image size/type | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| X cards, "Written by" and "Est. reading time" labels | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Schema graph | WebSite, Organization/Person, WebPage, ImageObject, BreadcrumbList, Article, Person, with Yoast's @id scheme | Similar | ✓ Yoast's @ids (`#website`, `#organization`, `#/schema/person/<hash>`, the permalink for WebPage, `#article`, `#breadcrumb`, `#primaryimage`). CollectionPage, ProfilePage and SearchResultsPage on archives. The person hash is stable and built from the user id (md5 of id + "user"), never the login, so it cannot confirm a guessed login name. |
| FAQ block | FAQ block | FAQ block | ✓ `seogo/faq` block, which adds FAQPage and Question nodes. Yoast's `yoast/faq-block` and Rank Math's `rank-math/faq-block` in imported content are read too. |
| How-to block | How-to block | HowTo block | ✓ `seogo/howto` block and the imported `yoast/how-to-block` and `rank-math/howto-block`. |
| Product schema | (WooCommerce SEO) | ✓ | ✓ Per post (article type Product). |
| LocalBusiness | Local SEO add-on | Local SEO | ✓ Local SEO module: business type, address, phone, email, price range, coordinates, opening hours. The organization node becomes a LocalBusiness. |
| Custom JSON-LD | — | Custom schema (Pro) | ✓ Per post: a node, a list or `@graph`. |

### Breadcrumbs

| Feature | Yoast | Rank Math | Pursae SEO |
|---|---|---|---|
| Settings | Separator, home anchor, prefixes, 404 text, bold last, blog page | Same, plus hide title | ✓ All of them. |
| Output | `yoast_breadcrumb()`, shortcode, block | `rank_math_the_breadcrumbs()`, shortcode, block | ✓ The `seogo/breadcrumbs` block (and `yoast-seo/breadcrumbs`). The `[seogo_breadcrumb]`, `[wpseo_breadcrumb]` and `[rank_math_breadcrumb]` shortcodes. BreadcrumbList schema. ◐ No PHP-style template function: Pursae themes are compiled, so the block and shortcode take its place. |

### Sitemaps, robots and indexing

| Feature | Yoast | Rank Math | Pursae SEO |
|---|---|---|---|
| XML sitemap index and per-type sitemaps | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ One sitemap per public post type (posts, pages, Pursae Commerce products, public Pursae Custom Fields types) and public taxonomy (categories, tags, product categories/tags/attributes, custom taxonomies), the same sources as core's `wp-sitemap.xml`, plus authors (left out while user enumeration is blocked, the core default). Paged at the configured size with one LIMIT/OFFSET query per page (the index only counts); lastmod; image entries (featured image and content images). Cart, Checkout and My account are never listed. With Pursae Multi Language in directory or query mode every language's content is listed with its own URL and `xhtml:link` hreflang alternates, each language's home leads the page sitemap, and `/{lang}/sitemap_index.xml` serves the same index; with a subdomain or a domain per language each host's sitemaps list only that host's language (a sitemap may not list another host's URLs). While the News or Video sitemap module is on, a public custom post type or taxonomy named `news` or `video` gets no per-type sitemap (`/news-sitemap.xml` and `/video-sitemap.xml` belong to those modules). The XSL stylesheet shows them in a browser. |
| Exclusions | noindex, per type | Per post/term IDs, per type | ✓ Noindexed, password-protected and canonicalized-elsewhere content, excluded post and term IDs, types switched off in Search Appearance, empty terms. |
| Replace core sitemaps | Disables `wp-sitemap.xml` and redirects | — | ✓ 301 from `/wp-sitemap*.xml` and `/sitemap.xml` to `/sitemap_index.xml`. |
| News sitemap | News SEO add-on | Pro | ✓ `news-sitemap.xml`: posts of the last 48 hours, publication name and language. |
| Video sitemap | Video SEO add-on | Pro | ◐ `video-sitemap.xml` for YouTube/Vimeo embeds, with title, description, thumbnail and player URL. Entries are de-duplicated per post, self-hosted `<video>`/core/video files are listed with `content_loc`, and an entry without a thumbnail (Vimeo or file with no featured image) is skipped because `thumbnail_loc` is required. No duration or video metadata lookup. |
| IndexNow | Yoast IndexNow (Premium) | Instant Indexing | ✓ Key file at `/<key>.txt`, automatic submission on publish/update, manual submission, last 20 responses (kept in the `seogo_indexnow_log` option), key regeneration. Only URLs the sitemap lists are submitted (sitemap post types, not noindex/password/excluded); 429, 5xx and network errors are retried up to three times. |

### Redirections and 404 monitor

| Feature | Yoast | Rank Math | Pursae SEO |
|---|---|---|---|
| Redirect types | 301, 302, 307, 410, 451 | 301, 302, 307, 410, 451 | ✓ |
| Matching | Plain, regex | Exact, contains, starts with, ends with, regex | ✓ All five; regex targets may use `$1`, `$2`… |

| Fallback for 404s | — | Redirect all 404s | ✓ An optional URL that every 404 is sent to. |

### Links and bulk editing

| Feature | Yoast | Rank Math | Pursae SEO |
|---|---|---|---|
| Link counter | Text link counter (internal/received) | Link counter | ✓ Internal, outbound and received links per post and page. |
| Orphaned content | Premium | — | ✓ Filter of the Link Counter, count on the dashboard. |
| Bulk editor | Tools › Bulk editor (titles, descriptions) | Bulk edit in posts list | ✓ SEO title, meta description and focus keyphrase for every sitemap post type (posts, pages, products, custom types), 50 per page with search and pagination, with SEO and readability scores. The dashboard, Link Counter and score recalculation cover the same types without a row limit (recalculation runs in batches; the orphan count is cached for five minutes and refreshed on every post save). |

### Images, import, REST

| Feature | Yoast | Rank Math | Pursae SEO |
|---|---|---|---|
| Image SEO (missing alt/title) | — | Image SEO (Pro) | ✓ Module: fills empty alt and missing title attributes in rendered content from templates (`%filename%`, `%title%`…). Tools: writes alt texts into the Media Library. |
| Import from Yoast / Rank Math | Import from other plugins | Import from Yoast and others | ✓ Data is read in place, copied during WXR import, and copied for all content in Tools. Redirects come in through CSV. |
| REST head endpoint | `GET /wp-json/yoast/v1/get_head?url=` → `{html, json, status}` | `GET /wp-json/rankmath/v1/getHead?url=` → `{success, head}` | ✓ Both, with the same shapes, plus `/wp-json/seogo/v1/get_head`. Only for URLs of this site; unpublished or protected content answers like a 404. |
| Term SEO fields | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ Edit Category / Edit Tag: focus keyphrase, title, description, noindex, canonical, breadcrumbs title, social fields. |

## Posts list, Commerce graph and automatic redirects

- **Posts list:** SEO and Readability traffic-light columns (from the stored `_seogo_seo_score` / `_seogo_read_score`) and filter views (`?seo_filter=nofocus|seo_bad|seo_good|read_bad|noindex`) on every sitemap post type.
- **Product schema:** a Pursae Commerce product page gets one `@graph` whose Product node is built from the store (real price, stock, reviews, `@id` `<url>#product`); the store's separate JSON-LD block is not printed while the schema module is on. The hand-filled Schema tab Product prints `aggregateRating` only when a rating and a real review count are both set.
- **Automatic redirects** also cover a changed term slug or parent (category, tag, custom taxonomies), next to the post slug redirect. Trashed or deleted content and Search Console reporting are not covered.

## Left out (and why)


- **Rank Math Analytics, Search Console, keyword rank tracking, Content AI, Yoast AI features, SEMrush/Wincher integrations.** These need external accounts and services; out of scope for a self-contained single site.
- **Yoast Insights, word complexity, inclusive language, text alignment, keyphrase distribution, Premium word forms and synonyms.** The analysis uses simple English stemming. Separate synonym fields and non-English language rules are not implemented.
- **Visual schema generator and schema templates (Rank Math Pro).** Covered by page/article type, Product, the FAQ and How-to blocks and custom JSON-LD.
- **`yoast_head` / `yoast_head_json` fields on `wp/v2` responses.** Adding them would change core REST output; headless clients use the get_head endpoints instead.
- **The admin bar SEO menu, the per-post redirect field, author-profile SEO fields, crawl optimization (removing feeds, shortlinks…), social image overlays, `llms.txt`, multiple local locations / KML.** The rest is small and can follow.
- **SEO analysis on the term edit screen.** Terms get the fields and head output, not the live traffic lights.
- **.htaccess editor.** Not applicable to Pursae.

Hooks into shared files are one or two lines each and are marked "Pursae SEO". They are in
`plugins.go`, `admin.go`, `server.go`, `site.go`, `site_head.go`, `site_view.go`, `feed.go`,
`admin_posts.go`, `rest_posts.go`, `admin_terms.go` and `wxr.go`.

### Pursae Commerce and Pursae Multi Language

- **Commerce views.** A product page reads the product's own SEO meta (and imported Yoast/Rank Math
  meta), featured image and description; `og:type` is `product`. Product category/tag archives use the
  term's SEO fields. Canonicals of products, product terms and the shop come from the store URLs (paged
  on page 2+, with `rel="prev"`), never from the synthetic page id. Cart, Checkout and My account are
  `noindex, follow` (WooCommerce's `wc_page_noindex`), also with Pursae SEO off. The product editor has
  the Pursae SEO box.
- **Languages.** `og:locale`, `og:locale:alternate` (the page's other languages), schema `inLanguage`
  (FAQ and HowTo included), `%sitename%`/`%sitedesc%`, `og:site_name` and the WebSite node follow the
  request language; the Home crumb links to the language's home. The Search Appearance templates and
  breadcrumb labels are listed in Languages › Translations (group "Pursae SEO").
